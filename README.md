### Timebanking Airway Heights
We took Timebanking Airway Heights and created their first logo and color scheme. The purpose was to give them look and culture that was appealing to bring in new users as well as keep an existing identity.

### Shadle Park Highschool
This redesign gave the school a new look that was new and fresh compared to the original design which was created when the school first opened in 1954. Colors were kept the same while the logo and crest were created with the schoolâ€™s history in mind.
